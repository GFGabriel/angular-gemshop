    "description": "Quartz which occurs in bands of yellow and purple has been given the name of ametrine (amethyst + citrine). Initially cutters favored windowed emerald shapes with a 50/50 split of colors, and much of the rough is still cut this way. More recently, however, some cutters have begun to cut a variety of shapes, many of which create internal reflections that blend the yellow and purple into attractive shades of rosy gold and mauve, or create mosaic-like flashes of both yellow and purple.",

    "name": "Emerald",
    "description": "Emerald is the most precious stone in the beryl group. The wonderful green color of emerald is unparalleled in the gem world. Most of the finest emerald available today is sourced from either Colombia, Zambia or Afghanistan. Emerald, by definition, is a medium or darker green to blue green beryl, in which the green color is derived from impurities of chromium, vanadium, or a combination of both. The most popular and valuable color is a slightly bluish green in a medium dark tone with strong to vivid saturation. Clarity is important, but inclusions are tolerated more in emerald than virtually any other gem.",
